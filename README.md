Snowflake
=========

Snowflake is a micro-game engine for JavaScript/CoffeeScript.

How does it work?
-----------------

```javascript
require(['flake/game'], function(Game) {
  new Game(function() {
  
    this.addScene('myscene', function() {
    
    });
  
  });
});
```

Building for yourself
---------------------
Type `grunt` to build everything.
